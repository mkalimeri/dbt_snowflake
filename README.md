The objective of this exercise is to transform raw ticketing data (events, venue
metadata, and transactions) into a clean analytical model using dbt and Snowflake.
The desired output is a fact table of sold transactions, enriched with event and venue
details, and includes a calculated revenue metric for each transaction.
